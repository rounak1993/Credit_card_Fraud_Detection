# Credit_card_Fraud_Detection_Classification_Project
Problem Definition

In recent years, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis and the delinquency is expected to peak in the third quarter of 2006 (Chou,2006).
In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, 
overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and cashâ€“card debts.
The crisis caused the blow to consumer finance confidence and it is a big challenge for both banks and cardholders

We used the [Credit Card Default payment in Taiwan] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) to predict whether the credit card holders are defaulters or Non-defaulters.

Objective

Using machine learning algorithms and techniques,we can analyze the features and patterns present in the dataset to train a model that can accurately predict whether a credit card holder 
is likely to default on their payments or not.

The dataset contains various attributes or features related to credit card holders, such as demographic information, payment history, bill amounts, and more. By leveraging this data, 
you can train a classification model that learns patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (default or non-default), allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen instances.

This information can be valuable for credit card issuers and financial institutions to take proactive measures, such as offering assistance, adjusting credit limits, or implementing risk management strategies,
to mitigate potential losses and manage credit card defaults effectively.
